# Range Expansion Index

Range Expansion Index (REI) is a custom oscillator indicator coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator was developed by Tom DeMark and first presented in his book _The New Science of Technical Analysis_. REI provides signals when the indicator crosses either level 60 or -60.

This implementation of the Range Expansion Index concept includes all alert types supported by the MetaTrader platform.
